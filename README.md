# Getting Started

When we were deciding how best to approach an app there were a few key things we want to add to the feature list:
-We wanted to make sure the mvp had a user-centric focus (which we decided would be most effective through google oauth) with the potential to later add an option for an app based account
-There was also a goal to allow the user to create, at minimum, their own gym routines that could be shared with others that the user also had the ability to edit, update, create, and delete.
-We also wanted to have viewable page where users could see all routines created by themselves and others

We also had some more ideas that could be incorporated later to further develop the idea of the app:
-One feature we considered as a strech goal and something to be added later is the ability for the user to create their own exercises in the database that any use could add to a routine
-Another possible feature disscused for potential integration is a comment and rating type of system around a users routine that would be attached other users who create the comment
-There were also some other UX elements that could create for a cleaner user experience like adding an auto complete feature when populating a routine with exercises

To get started on our product we at least wanted to add the basic functioanlity that could easily be built upon later

# Technologies Used
When looking through what tools we wanted to use to create our project we choose to use a variety of different technologies with express using a variety of dependencies as the backbone. The technologies used include: passport(using google oauth), ejs(as a view engine), javascript, CSS, Mongoose, and MongoDB.


# Next Steps and Difficulties
When going through the design we had some errors that still could use some work
For example one difficulty we encountered was getting the exercise data to properly log on the page. This was somehting that we had spent a lot of time to overcome.
Another feature we wanted to add was more user ability to edit exercise data that was contained inside of the routine. This functionality would be important to add in a future version of the app to improve the user exeperience.
We believe the immedaite next steps in the app would be to go through and flesh out more of the ability for the user to interact with the exercises through creating them rather than fully relying on them being only seeded from the database
