# Getting Started

When we were deciding how best to approach an app there were a few key things we want to add to the feature list:
-We wanted to make sure the app had a user-centric focus (which we decided would be most effective through google oauth to start) with the potential ability later to add the option for an app based account
-There was also a goal to allow the user to create, at minimum, their own gym routines that could be shared with others that the user also had full control over

We also had some more ideas that could be incorporated later to further develop the idea of the app:
-One feature we considered as a strech goal and something to be added later is the ability for the user to create their own exercises in the database that any use could add to a routine
-Another possible feature disscused for potential integration is a comment and rating type of system around a users routine that would be attached other users who create the comment
-There were also some other UX elements that could create for a cleaner user experience like adding an auto complete feature when populating a routine with exercises

To get started on our product we at least wanted to add the basic functioanlity that could easily be built upon later

# Technologies Used
When looking through what tools we wanted to use to create our project we choose to use a variety of different technologies with express using a variety of dependencies as the backbone. The technologies used include: passport(using google oauth), ejs(as a view engine), javascript, CSS, Mongoose, and MongoDB.
